        <h2>Outcome 2</h2> 
        <h3>2.1 Reviewing the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed</h3>
        <p>
        In making my own website, I am somewhat happy with the tools I have used. The laptop provided for me ran Windows 10 Pro which was effective for the use of Visual Studio Code. From a basic tutorial from Instructor Liam about getting started using Visual Studio Code, I learnt to begin building my website by selecting a html5 file type and naming my first page (or Home Page) ‘index.html’. From there it was a matter of learning how to anchor reference elements and embed links within these anchors.<br>
        It may have been beneficial to consider Atom or Eclipse as similar alternatives to Visual Studio code, but our current cohort was recommended Visual Studio Code for its ease of access and usability for first time coders at Trafford College.<br>
        Now, a brief word about Trello. Trello is advantageous for its ease of use to get started on managing a project or managing workflow for a particular project, yet there are many alternatives for effective kanban tools which may be preferred over Trello. [15] For example, some users may like to manipulate in greater detail how they make use of the kanban system and modify the code for how their tool operates. There are several competing kanban tools to Trello which are classed as ‘open source’ which would allow for greater personalisation if someone wanted to see exactly how their tools work. Two such examples of these are Taiga [16] and Restya [17]. 
        Github is useful for version control of code.</p>

        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello.</h3>
        <p>The IT tools selected, namely Visual Studio Code and Trello were appropriate for the projects given. Visual Studio Code has enabled me to design and operate my first web pages. I found it remarkably useful for managing my html content and applying CSS successfully. Trello was appropriate for this opening project as it was user-friendly and able to present a good visual overview of my workflow. </p>

        <h3>2.3 Assessing the strengths and weaknesses of my final project</h3>
        <p>This review is being done on my website itself, in the interests of openness. With it being a first time attempt, I am happy with my website. It is functional and presents its content clearly. Perhaps it does not appear hyper-modern or sleek, but with more time and creative content input I could develop my blog appearances further. Something specific which I would like to add to my website design is the application of the hover tool in CSS. That is, when hovering the mouse over buttons, a slight change in the button colour or button shape would make tracking the cursor visibly easily. If I could change something else about my website it would be to implement a digital technology theme which would make use of pictures that are neither too bland nor too intrusive; these pictures would act to beautify but not detract from my website contents. These pictures (or simple graphics, or artistic sketches) would, for example, have my html text boxes wrap around them, or wrap to one side of them. </p>

        <h3>2.4 Further improvements</h3>
        <p>Further improvements I could make to my project is to present snippets of code I have written to demonstrate my learning of Python from the first half of the Develop: Coding course with Code nation. They might be presented as cropped screenshots highlighting my favorite parts of code as typed using IDLE on this laptop and the result (or output) from running these parts of code. Further to the activities and coding challenges set by my Code Nation Instructor, I searched for my own resources where I could develop my coding skills and practice them with external challenges.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Reviewing outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h3>
        <p>Outcomes have been reviewed and were found to be fit for purpose. </p>

        <h2>Outcome 3 (Also a Review)</h2> 

        <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency</h3>
        <p>One way I could have been more efficient when making my website would be to define SMART goals. These goals would be specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-based. This would have been especially effective for boosting productivity, considering the amount of time I (lost) spent reading and learning about CSS. Time seemed to vanish as I was often sidetracked into reading about additional CSS tools and techniques beyond the basics, intrigued by more and more possibilities, realising only with hindsight that many of them were not necessary for this project. Website creation and design could have been done it in teams! (See below)</p>

        <h3>3.2 Describing ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h3>
        <p>Working in a team could have been superior to working alone on my project if tasks were split between team members. For example, the functionality of linking pages to each other within a website could be assigned to one person, whilst the matter of designing the aesthetic appearance of buttons used for navigating these pages could be given to another team member. Teams can provide constructive critique to other teams about each other’s web pages, with a broader range of feedback likely to be received due to more people being involved on each project.</p>

        <h3>3.3 Developing solutions to improve my own productivity using IT in digital projects</h3> 
        <p>As someone whose strength lies in being a team player, more naturally inclined to work with, discuss ideas with, and encourage peers, something I would do differently next time would be to form a team using Slack as a means of communication and marking progress.</p>

        <h3>3.4 How to go about testing digital solutions</h3>
        <p>Work can be presented on a GitHub repository where it is made public and can be critiqued by others. Seeking other forums where work can be shared and discussed would be effective for peer review. However, specifically speaking, testing digital solutions can be performed by dedicated software testing companies such as Qualitest. It is stated that ‘as well as functional, security, performance and load testing, digital testing should cover API, network, machine learning and big data testing.’ [18]
