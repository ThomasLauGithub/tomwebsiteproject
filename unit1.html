    <h2>Unit 1 Outcomes: Improving Productivity with IT</h2>
    <p>In this outcome, I plan, select and use appropriate IT systems and software to meet my needs. Since I wish to establish myself as a consultant and prove my knowledge, I begin by creating a blog in which I talk about myself and why I am interested in technology. I produce this to demonstrate how much I know. For each of the descriptive sections below a paragraph of information about the topic has been produced. </p>
    
    <h3>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h3>
        <p>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business 
        Information technology has become the bread and butter of most modern businesses. It is regarded as a driver for innovation and innovation is the path to business success. It has been said that innovation in business has the same impact that steam had on the industrial revolution. [2] Let’s consider an example: For many companies, email is the main means of communication between employees, suppliers and customers. Email was one of the early drivers of the Internet, providing a simple and inexpensive means to communicate. Over the years, several other communications tools have also evolved, allowing staff to communicate using live chat systems, online meeting tools and video-conferencing systems. [3]</p>

    <h3>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully</h3>
        <p>( what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? )
        In order to complete digital projects successfully a variety of resources can be used such as Trello. Trello is an online based resource tool which is known for its ease of use and popularity amongst software developers. [4] It is particularly useful for creating task lists and for the application of the widely recognised Kanban system, a visual system employed for managing work as it transitions through the stages of ‘to do’, ‘doing’, and ‘done’. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks of  project work and fix them so that the work continues to flow cost-effectively towards the point of completion. [5] Particularly useful for software developers is GitHub. Moreover, Git is a revision control system, a tool to manage source code history. GitHub is a hosting service for Git repositories. It is worthy of note that they are not the same thing: Git is the tool, GitHub is the service for projects that use Git. [6]<br>
        <br>
        In addition, personal professional skills are of great value when applied to digital projects. For example, time management skills are essential for leading a project successfully. The ability to work in a team cannot be overlooked as much of the work of digital projects revolve around good collaboration.</p>
        
    <h3>1.3 Planning and carrying out tasks using IT (Website Creation)</h3>
        <p>On of the ways I use to plan and carry out tasks using IT is with the use of a specialised Trello board. Here is a link to one of mine: https://trello.com/b/Hnxc8xHl/tom-laus-develop-coding-unit-1-project-1 On here I have dedicated columns for specific tasks under TO DO, DOING, and DONE. As a particular task is being worked on I manoeuvre the card associated with that task into the ‘Doing’ column, so that at a glance any member of the public could see exactly where I am up to on my project work, see what has already been completed and what has still yet to be done. <br>
        <br>
        I do all the above with the use of a Lenovo laptop. The laptop is of the ‘ThinkPad’ variety and serves me well due its lightness of weight and portability. Occasionally I bring my own wireless mouse which can be connected with a USB nano receiver which fits snugly into the laptop’s USB port. This allows me to circumnavigate everything accessible on the screen (e.g. websites, document configurations, code editing) with greater dexterity than even the best touchpad user. </p>

    <h3>1.4 Risks that may impact digital projects</h3>
        <p>(Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?)
        With projects in general, many, many risks can be listed which may range from the project scope being ill-defined to it having insufficient funding, from stakeholder conflict to the project incurring legal liability. [7] Digital projects, however, are uniquely subject to certain key risks. They suffer from the threat of potential cyber attacks, targeted hacking, or inaccessibility due to technological faults. Digital projects are notoriously difficult to estimate and schedule, often suffer from inflation of requirements as they progress, employee turnover and poor productivity. For example, if the scope of a digital project is not clearly defined, or is too broad, a sense of urgency may be lacking and so work may tend to expand to fill the time available. [8]</p>

    <h3>1.5 Selecting and using IT systems and software</h3>
        <p>( how do you select the right kind of technology for the job? )
        One must begin by thinking critically about what the project in question requires. It is often beneficial to write a list of basic needs in order to complete a project, or even just to get it up and running.  Some examples of this are a stable internet connection, sufficiently powerful laptops/ macbooks, a platform for testing the project, and a way to present the project product upon completion. Candidate options should be listed and research performed on each item, noting the search hints provided about refining web searches [9]. competing choices of a particular item, a simple pros and cons list can help clarify which option would make for the best choice. If further analysis is required, a S.W.O.T. analysis can be performed on the various options. [10] However, sometimes the choice of IT systems and software is dictated by the umbrella company or company headquarters if they are keen to limit spending. In that case choice is limited simply to what IT systems and software resources are already available. </p>

    <h3>1.6 How my chosen technologies have helped me achieve your outcomes</h3>
        <p>Trello has been key in helping me plan my work in small steps and by creating cards and positioning them under the relevant columns of ‘To Do’, ‘Doing’, and ‘Done’. Visual Studio Code has enabled me to prepare my website structure with ease using html5. Since it has the ability to track the progress of code over time, I am able to view the version histories of my codes. By creating a repository on GitHub I have been able to manage my project carefully. A repository is like a folder for your project. Your project's repository contains all of your project's files and stores each file's revision history. It is also possible to discuss and manage your project work within the repository. [11]</p>

    <h3>1.7 A brief description of legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects</h3>
        <p>It is important to be aware of individual rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).  The GDPR provides the following rights for individuals: the right to be informed, right of access, right to rectification, right to erasure/to be forgotten, right to restrict processing, right to data portability, right to object and rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.
