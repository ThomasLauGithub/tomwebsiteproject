        <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
        <p>HTML was used to describe the content and layout for each of my pages. HTML allowed me to see the fundamental structure of my pages before applying any artistic effects and colours via CSS.</p>
        
        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
        <p>Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because they may restrict what a website is able to publish. Perhaps the best way to circumvent this is to first obtain permission from the original author. Secondly, if one wishes to publish information on their site which comes from another site, creating a link to it and perhaps seeking permission to publish an excerpt from the original site is a reasonable way to go about this.</p>
        
        <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h2>
        <p>(describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them)
        For those with visual impairments, learning difficulties, hearing loss and more, there are dozens of unique challenges presented from the vast majority of URLs. Webpages can improve their accessibility for people with disabilities by taking into account a few considerations. Building a disability-friendly site can be achieved with a few simple steps. [13]. For example, it is of great help if alt tags are included. Alt tags are those little words which pop up when the cursor controlled by the mouse hovers over an image on a website. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader the alt tags are read aloud, and these are the only way a user knows what the image is.</p>
        
        <h2> 1.7 Describe which are the appropriate file types for websites</h2>
        <p>The most common files on web servers are: webpages, images, scripts, and programs. ‘.html’ and ‘.htm’ are the two extensions that are standard for webpages. They can be used interchangeably. ‘.html’ was the original extension for HTML pages on Unix web hosting machines. It references any file that is HTML (or XHTML). ‘.htm’ was created by Windows/DOS because of its requirement for 3 character file extensions. It also references HTML (and XHTML) files and can be used on any web server, regardless of the operating system. [14] ‘index.htm’ or ‘index.html’ is the default page in a directory on most web servers. The first page of a website should be named ‘index.html’ to allow someone to go to that web page without them having to type a file name. [14]</p>
